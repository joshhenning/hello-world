# hello-world

Hey all. 

I've been managing teams in workplace technology and infrastructure for several years, and feel that my leadership and management skills are strong.

However, I cannot code, and would like to learn enough to have a better understanding of what most of the engineering org does each day. 

I'm also interested in expanding my own skill sets, and look forward to clumsily building my own small projects.
